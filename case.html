    <div><p>During my design challenge I was tasked to design an interface for an infotainment system. For this project we chose to work with a target group of people over the age of 50. We chose for this challenging target group because technology continues to advance and we wanted to ensure that those who may not necessarily be technically advanced to feel included as well. Via this perspective we took into consideration that our target group may experience difficulties in focusing when switching between the road and the infotainment system. So we had to ensure that every single interaction with the infotainment system would be done safely and confidently.</p></div>
